# P422 Project

Thomas Woods
Project proposal.

	I would like to make a small maze game.  The minimum amount of things that I would like to have it due are as follows:
*	Create and use accounts for individual users.
*	Procedurally generate a map of at least 6x6.
*	Seed generation based on username.
*	Text to describe current location in map. (think text based adventure).
If minimum requirements end up being easy to implement and can be done before project due date, these additional features will be considered and implemented into game:
*	Locked doors and keys can generate in map.
*	Enemies with simple behaviors, and weapons generating in map.
*	Bigger possible map generation.
*	Option for seed generation based on user specified phrase
*	Option for random map generation.
*	Difficulty selection:
    *	Easy: no enemies, 6x6 size map, no doors
    *	Normal: no enemies, 25x25 size map, doors and keys generate
    *	Hard: enemies, 100x100 size map, doors and keys generate
*	Images to replace text description.
*	Score based on several factors:
    *	Minimum amount of moves
    *	Enemies defeated
    *	Items found
